        <h3>Easy to cook chicken adobo</h3>
        <p>Classic chicken adobo recipe that&rsquo;s simple to make and loved by all who try it. It has been modified to be a bit saucier than traditional and is deliciously served over rice.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 (3 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>

            <li>2/3 cup low sodium soy sauce</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken pieces until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add onion and garlic to the skillet; cook until softened and brown, about 6 minutes. Pour in soy sauce and vinegar and season with garlic powder, black pepper, and bay leaf.</li>
